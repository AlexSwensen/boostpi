APPLYING THIS CONFIGURATION WILL VOID YOUR PI's WARRANTY.
This configuration will set a permanent bit on your pi that can detect if you have overclocked your pi.

BOOT_WARNING = """
VERY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

In the event your pi is unable to boot, or is unstable, disconnect power from the pi.
While holding the left shift key down, plug in power and wait until the OS has booted.
This will cause the pi to ignore overclock settings during startup.
Once the pi has booted, you can release the shift key and run `python -m boostpi --reset` to reset the pi's overclocking settings to factory defaults.
