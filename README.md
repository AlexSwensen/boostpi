# boostpi
A simple overclocking configuration tool for the raspberry pi built with python


## Installation

```
$ pip install boostpi
```

Launch with:

```
$ sudo python -m boostpi
```
_note_: sudo is required in order to access and modify the /boot partition, where overclocking configuration files are stored.

## Compatibility

Below is a comprehensive list of raspberry pi boards and their compatibility status. Supporting this project will allow me to add support for more boards!

Keep in mind that each board has different revisions, so your specific board may or may not be supported.

As of the current writing the tool is a work-in-progress, and as such is incompatible with all boards.

This will be updated when the tool is ready for use.
